Open Command Prompt (CMD) and navigate to the YOLOv5 directory:
cd yolov5
Install Required Libraries:
Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Object Detection Using Camera:
To enable object detection using your webcam, enter the following command in CMD:
python detect.py --source 0
This command activates the camera (denoted by --source 0) and uses it as the input for real-time object detection.
Object Detection Using a Predefined Database:
To perform object detection using images from a specific directory, use:
python detect.py --weights yolov5x.pt --source "path_to_your_database"
Replace "path_to_your_database" with the actual path to your image database. This command specifies the model weights (yolov5x.pt) and the source directory containing your images.
Notes:
Ensure that Python and pip are correctly installed on your system before running these commands.
The --weights argument specifies the model weights file, which you need to have downloaded in your YOLOv5 folder.
Replace path_to_your_database with the actual file path to your image database for accurate object detection.
